# DawsonV1.0

**Dawson** is a project designed around the idea of automating difficult parts of life.

The project in the repo is a Flask/MongoDB/HTML5/CSS fullstack web application that's an upgrade to a classic 'to-do' list application. It uses Tensorflow and WhisperAI to convert uploaded audio files into parsed tasks that you can add to your list.

### Upcoming DawsonV2.0 features:
+ Microphone feature for real time text-to-task parsing
+ Mobile App
+ **Deployment of Web and Mobile Applications**

### Upcoming DawsonV3.0 features:
+ **Wearable Microphone device**

### Backburner Features (DawsonVx.x):
+ Schedule Feature
+ Smart task time and subject sorting
+ Location based task sorting & mobile integration
+ Refined classification (time-tense sensitive)
+ User specific voice recognition

### Vision:
*This project is intended to be accessible to individuals who are interested in implimenting the same thing I was, automation and improved ease of life.*

*To this note, this program is intended to be personally integrated (as I think trusting someone else with all of your audio data borders a privacy violation), so upon finishing, the setup, services used, hardware used, etc. for the final version will be posted here or likely in a linked repository in order to provide access*
